<div id="p1"> <b> "Thinking Out Loud" is a song by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran, recorded for his second studio album,
(2014). It was written by Sheeran and Amy Wadge,[2] and produced by frequent collaborator Jake Gosling. It was released in
 the US on 24 September 2014 as the album's third single.</p>

<p>In the UK, the song spent 19 weeks within the top 40 before peaking at number one in early November 2014; it became Sheeran's
 second number one single there. The single has also reached the top spot in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Denmark, the Netherlands,
 Slovakia and South Africa, and peaked at number two on both the US Billboard Hot 100 and the Canadian Hot 100.
 It was Sheeran's highest-charting single in North America until "Shape of You" topped the charts in both countries in 2017.
